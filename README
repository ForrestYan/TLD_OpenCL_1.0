This will be a OpenCL implementations of the OpenTLD 
Based on the C++ Implementation of alantrrs(https://github.com/alantrrs/OpenTLD.git)
The frame frequence increased about for 4 times without any detection performance loss

Before runing the Code 
the computer must have OpenCV and OpenCL environment


Installation Notes
=====================================
git clone https://github.com/ForrestYan/TLD_OpenCL_1.0.git
cd TLD_OpenCL_1.0
make

%To run from camera
./run_tld -p ./parameters.yml -tl
%To run from file
./run_tld -p ./parameters.yml -s ./06_car/car.mpg -tl
%To init bounding box from file
./run_tld -p ./parameters.yml -s ./06_car/car.mpg -b ./06_car/init.txt -tl
%To train only in the firs frame (no tracking, no learning)
./run_tld -p ./parameters.yml -s ./06_car/car.mpg -b ./06_car/init.txt 
%To test the final detector (Repeat the video, first time learns, second time detects)
./run_tld -p ./parameters.yml -s ./06_car/car.mpg -b ./06_car/init.txt -tl -r

Thanks
====================================
To Zdenek Kalal for realeasing his awesome algorithm
To Alantrrs for realeasing his C++ implement of TLD algorithm
